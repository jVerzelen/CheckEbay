Purpose     Checking and notifying me when a new item is listed for an Ebay search I am interested in.
            When new items are found it will show a trayicon in the Windows tray and show a notification (unless muted).
            Clicking the trayicon opens the urls to the searches that have new items added.
            Right-Click to mute (icon will still light up when new items are added, but no notification is shown).

Reason      Ebay offers you to follow searches and will send you an email when items get added for this search.
            However, Ebay will only send you 1 email at the end of the day with all new items listed. (Sometimes I even received emails when no new items were added.)
            The problem is that items could have been listed and already sold by that time.

            This software checks the searches more often and notifies me immediately.

Notes       This software was quickly put together when I needed it. Speed was prioritized above all else.
            Since I only needed to use this once it has no View/User input whatsoever.
            This code is bad and not representative of the way I normally write code
            This should only be seen as an example of how I sometimes write software to make my life easier/more efficient.
